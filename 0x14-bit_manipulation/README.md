<h1> Bit Manipulation </h1>

<h3>Lessons learned so far:</h3>
<ul>
<li> tilde '~' = NOT LOGIC operator (but it's weird and still needs more
understanding)</li>
<li>& = AND </li>
<li> | = Inclusive OR (OR) </li>
<li> ^ = Exclusive OR (XOR) </li>
</ul>

<p> And that's about it I think.. This readme will look awful, but I'm here for
it</p>
